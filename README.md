# raspi-gpio-glyphs
This repository contaions data required to display glyphs, as seen in the popular online game, [Ingress] (http://www.ingress.com/), on a special matrix of LEDs via a Raspberry Pi and several jumper cables.
# Glyphs
The Ingress glyphs are, supposedly, used by an organization of supernatural entities known as 'Shapers'. To display them, the following matrix is used:

![Calibration Grid glyph](https://github.com/danya02/raspi-gpio-glyphs/blob/master/glyph-raster/Calibration-Grid.png)

Those glyphs are displayed as a sequence of connected points on the grid. For example, here is what a typical glyph looks like:

![Being/Human glyph](https://github.com/danya02/raspi-gpio-glyphs/blob/master/glyph-raster/Being-Human.png)

The information about glyphs is taken from the [Glyphionary] (http://glyphionary.com) website.
